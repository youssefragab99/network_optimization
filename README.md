# Network Optimization

### Problem 

In this problem, we have a list of 11 possible locations, servicing 38 clients. In this scenario, each client's demand can be fully supplied by any location, and there is no limit to how many clients a single location can service. 

### Data Available

We have two different datasets, the first one, f_cost.csv, gives us the fixed cost of building a faciity at a specific location The second file, s_cost.csv, gives us the variable cost of servicing a client from every location. Where the columns are the clients, and the rows show us the cost of servicing client j from location i.

### The Goal

The goal is to find the optimal combination of locations to build a facility in order to service all the clients at the lowest possible price.
